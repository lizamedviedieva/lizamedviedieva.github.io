			<center><p>Hey! To start with, my name is Liza and I absolutely love traveling! In this blog you will find a lot of travel inspiration </p>
			<p>and even advice how to save money while traveling. Now, a little bit about me. Originally I come from Ukraine, but now I study </p>
			<p>in LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania. Three years ago, I got the unique opportunity to go to USA as an exchange </p>
			<p>student and that was the moment I realized - traveling is something that I cannot live without. During the last school year I visited </p>
			<p>15 new countries and I managed to do on a low budget. So, join me on my journey and let's get started ❤ </p></center>
