		<p> To recent times, while traveling, I always used <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/" title="Go to Couchsurfing website">Couchsurfing</a> website. It is a unique opportunity not only to save hundreds of bucks while living free, but also meet locals and try out their lifestyle! It's highly advisable to travel via <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/" title="Go to Couchsurfing website">Couchsurfing</a> with friends just for the sake of safety. I was hosted with the help of <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/" title="Go to Couchsurfing website">Couchsurfing</a> in 10 different countries and by any means each of the experiences was unique. Try it out and see if this is a good option for you!</p>

		<p> To find cheap flight fares I use <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/" title="Go to Ryanair website">Ryanair</a> and <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb#/" title="Go to Wyzzair website">Wyzzair</a> websites. If you don't have any destination in mind, they offer the cheapest flights from the closes airport to you, so it's a good way to start traveling on budget. You can find fares as cheap as 10 EUR to get to Norway, everything depends on your searching skills and timing!</p>

		<p> For getting around in Europe to close distances use <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/" title="Go to FlixBus website">FlixBus</a>. The tickets start from around 1 EUR and you can travel even between countries.
